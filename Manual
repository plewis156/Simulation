Paul Lewis
Simulation

User's Manual

The program has been written tested in Linux (Mint) and compiled using GCC.

main() is contained in simulation.c

There is a working Makefile. Compile with make command.

Alternatively the program can be compiled using the command
    gcc -Wall -o simulation simulation.c heap.c FIFOqueue.c customer.c -lm

The program can be run using the command
    ./simulation
The program does not accept any parameters.

When the program runs, it will display the a priori calculations in the console, then after
running the simulation it will display the a posteriori results of the simulation.

The only input file necessary is "simulation.txt". It must be contained in the
same directory as the running program.
The format of simulation.txt should be four integers each on their own line
lambda (e.g. 2)
mu (e.g. 3
M (e.g. 2)
N (e.g. 5000)

Output goes to the console.

All features work and their are no known bugs.
